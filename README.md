# Admin Dashboard Project

## Overview

This is a project assignment from the odin project that requires us to build an admin dashboard using advanced grid layout system.

In this project, I learned to integrate custom css grid to tailwind to achieve desired design outcome.

## Features

Technologies used in this projects include:

- React
- Typescript
- Tailwind
- Custom css grid
- Other: prettier, husky, lintstage ...

### Continued development

While this web application boasts a robust and completed front-end, there are still a few limitations. There are no back end at all, once I have a better grasp of back-end, I hope to create a complete admin dashboard with database and user interactivity in the future.
