# Admin Dashboard Project

## Overview

This is a project assignment from the Odin Project that requires us to build an admin dashboard using advanced grid layout system.

In this project, I learned to integrate custom css grid with tailwind to achieve the desired design outcome.

## Features

Technologies used in this project include:

- React
- Typescript: The maintenance announcement has been dynamically set to create a mock-up date three days from the current date of user visiting the web application.
- Tailwind
- Custom advanced css grid properties
- Material Design Icons
- Other: Prettier, Husky, Lintstage ...

### Continued development

While this web application boasts a robust and completed front-end, there are still a few limitations. There are no back-end at all, once I have a better grasp of back-end, I hope to create a complete admin dashboard with database and user interactivity in the future.
